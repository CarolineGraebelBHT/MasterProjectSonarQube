Each of these code smells can have multiple tags. There can be multiple code smells of the same type, so that in theory there would be a distribution of tags in comparison to all tags that SonarQube can assign to an issue. To make this predictable, the approach is to collect all tags for code smells for one commit and make this list the label.
